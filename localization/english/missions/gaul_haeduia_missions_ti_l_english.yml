 me_gaul_haeduia_ti_2_title: "$gaul_haeduia_task_2$"
 me_gaul_haeduia_ti_2_desc: "Many of our advisors push us to directly extend our influence over neighboring lands. Their inhabitants have shown reluctance to join our federation willingly. We must decide whether to forcibly make them pay tribute, bringing them into our fold under our terms, or to resort to more forceful measures and confront them in open conflict."
 me_gaul_haeduia_ti_2.a: "Establish a tributary state."
 me_gaul_haeduia_ti_2.b: "Let us not be hasty."

 me_gaul_haeduia_ti_8_desc: "It seems Arvernia is not at all open to the possibility of cooperation; they are so blind in rage that they cannot see that a united Gaul is the only path to protect our families and homes.
