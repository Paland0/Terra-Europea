Of an army, there is truly nothing more we could ask. What was once fledgling and primitive, is now grand and powerful."

 me_gaul_arvernia_ti_29_desc: "With Rome in our sights, a major development is being discussed within our court. Are we yet ready to take the title of empire? It would add a certain aura around our nation, a powerful reminder of who we are as Gaul and what all we want to accomplish, but it might ruffle some feathers of those who would rather keep things as is. The time of debate is over, the time for decision is now."
 me_gaul_arvernia_ti_29.a: "Gaul is deserving of an empire and an empire we shall be"

 me_gaul_arvernia_ti_200_desc: "Our decision to establish a tributary state in the neighboring lands has yielded results. With a display of military might and diplomatic finesse, we have managed to bring the inhabitants under our influence, albeit under terms that acknowledge our supremacy. They now pay tribute to our federation, and while their autonomy has been curtailed, they will continue to exist with nominal independence as part of our growing federation of Gallic peoples."

 me_gaul_arvernia_ti_1300_desc: "With the proclamation of the Gaulish Federation, some tribal chiefs have started scheming for power and influence within this new union. They argue that a strong central authority is needed to maintain order and unity. As a result, there is a growing movement to embrace monarchy as the governing system of the Gaulish Federation.

 me_gaul_arvernia_ti_1500_desc: "As we deliberate the path to expanding our Gaulish Federation, two main camps have developed among the leader men of Gaul. The first group advocates for a campaign of conquest and assimilation, utilizing our military strength to swiftly subdue neighboring territories and bring them into our fold. Others advocate for a more measured approach claiming that wayward Gauls should be coaxed to joining us, not slaughtered."
 me_gaul_arvernia_ti_1500.a: "Conquest is the only way."
