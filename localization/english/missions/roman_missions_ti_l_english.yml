This culminated with Emperor Aurelianus elevating him to one of the premier deities of the Roman Empire: Sol's priests became pontifices and members of the college of pontiffs, the Temple of the Sun was built in the Campus Agrippae, and henceforth the 25th of December was celebrated as Dies Natalis Solis Invicti, birthday of Sol Invictus."
